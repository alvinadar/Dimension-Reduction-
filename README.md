#Dimension reduction technique 

#For unsupervised  Feature extraction. 

* Transform the original data into smaller set of new variables. 
* The new features are combinations of the old ones. 
* Techniques: 
    * PCA(Principle Component Analysis).
    * LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis).
    * t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ).
    *	UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
    * Autoencoders (Neural Networks for compression).

`Pros:`Captures hidden structure , powerfull for visualiztion. 

`Cons`: New features are harder to interpret.
